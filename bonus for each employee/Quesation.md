You are the head of the sales team at the company. There are N salespersons in your team. At the end of each month you have the task of giving them bonus (money) based on their ratings (the more active a salesperson the higher their rating is). You do this task based on the following rules:

1. The rating is a number from 1 to 10. 

2. Each salesperson must have at least one dollar as bonus.

3. Salespersons with a higher rating must get more bonus than their colleagues with lower ratings.



Write an algorithm to assign the bonus for each employee. Assume the input is an array where A[i] is the rating for salesperson i.

Example: input: A ={1,6,3,1} 

              output: Bonus = {1,3,2,1}
